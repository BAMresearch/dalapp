# DataStore Advanced Label App

Work in progress ;) This shall be, one day: 

- A web interface (or DataStore extension) for batch generation of labels with QR codes for samples
- Extend QR code generation by additional info & formats (for tiny, normal and big bottles), very related to the solution of Çağtays group: qrcodes.pdf
- Allow custom label layout, predefined layouts allow for standardization as well 
- Key features:
    - web interface, accessibility on each PC with DataStore access, no installation of anything
    - Generate standard A4 PDF files to be printed on regular network printers anywhere, no special hardware or drivers
    - Allow to predefine label grids for widely used label sheets, e.g. Herma
    - Select multiple sample objects quickly, e.g. in a DataStore listing
    - Technical thoughts:
        - Javascript should be suitable for this, as it can be used by any employee in the webbrowser and requires no additional hardware or setup.
        
Open for collaboration!
